<h2><a name="THE_LAKE_OF_LUCERNE" id="THE_LAKE_OF_LUCERNE">THE LAKE OF LUCERNE</a></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>If Lucerne is the most widely advertised lake in
the world&mdash;if its name, in recent years, has come
to be associated, less with ancient gallant exploits
of half-legendary William Tells than with cheap
Polytechnic Tours and hordes of personally
conducted trippers, it has luckily forfeited
singularly little of its ancient charm and character,
and remains, if you visit it at the right
moment&mdash;or at any moment, if you are not too
fastidious in your claims for solitude and æsthetic
exclusiveness&mdash;possibly the most beautiful and
unquestionably the most dramatic and striking of
all the half-dozen or so greater lakes, Swiss or
Italian, that cluster round the outskirts of the
great central knot of Alps. "Cluster round the
outskirts," for it is characteristic of all these
lakes, just as it is characteristic of most of our
greater English meres at home&mdash;of Windermere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
for example, or Bassenthwaite, or Ullswater&mdash;that,
though their upper ends penetrate more
or less deeply (and Lucerne and Ullswater more
deeply than any) among the bases of the hills,
yet their lower reaches, whence discharge the
mighty rivers, invariably trail away into open
plain, or terminate among mere gentle undulations.
Of all this class of lake, then&mdash;lakes of
the transition&mdash;Lucerne is at once the most
complex in shape, the least comprehensible in
bulk, and the most immediately mountainous in
character. The most complex in shape, because,
though it is usual to describe this as a cross, yet the
cross is so distorted in its lower and major member
as practically to lose all really cross-like character,
and to remind one rather of a wriggling viper.
The least comprehensible in bulk, because there
is actually no point on its surface, or on its
immediate margin, or perhaps indeed anywhere,
whence it is possible to grasp its basin as a whole,
as it is possible, for example, in a rough kind
of way, to grasp the shape and dimension of such
a much larger lake as Geneva from the vineyards
in the neighbourhood of Aubonne. The most
immediately mountainous in character, because
no other big Swiss lake, as already intimated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
extends itself so deeply into the heart of giant
hills, or is bordered so immediately by steep and
rugged mountains. Thus Lucerne gains in
surprise and mystery what it loses in simple
graciousness; is dramatic and startling where
other lakes are tranquil and merely soothing;
and is certainly, to sum up, the most splendid
and magnificent lake in the Alps, if not the most
dignified and beautiful.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Those who approach Lucerne directly by the
railway fitly approach the most dramatic of lakes
by the most dramatic of vestibules. For those
who use their eyes, indeed, there are abundant
distant hints of the coming splendour; the Alps
are first visible, in tolerably clear weather, as we
descend the long wall of Jura on to the Aar at
Aarberg; and further on, beyond the peaty flats
round the Mauensee, and as we quit the lake of
Sempach, Pilatus and Rigi, like two tall <span class="locked">sentinels&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Mountains that like giants stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sentinel enchanted land"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">come suddenly into view as the railway describes
a giant curve, whilst between them, at greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
distance, is glimpsed the enchanted land itself,
made substantial in the Alps of Unterwalden.
Such, too, or something similar, was the young
Ruskin's first view of the distant Alps on the
Sunday afternoon from the city promenade at
Schaffhausen. "Infinitely beyond all that we
had ever thought or dreamed&mdash;the seen walls of
lost Eden could not have been more beautiful to
us; not more awful, round heaven, the walls of
sacred Death." Yet in spite of these reiterated
hints, previsions, and premonitions, when we
step finally from the noise, and bustle, and
subdued light of the railway-station at Lucerne
into the brilliant morning light of the river quays
outside, the great vision that then breaks upon
us for the first time in its entirety&mdash;levels of
shining lake, and long, horizontal precipices
of wooded Rigi, and beyond, in splendid background,
white confusion of shattered Alps,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"A thousand shadowy pencilled valleys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snowy dells in a golden air"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">startles and almost shocks us with the same
sense of unearthly wonder as when for the first
time in childhood the green baize curtain rolls
up suddenly, and we gaze, with child's eyes,
straight into the green mysteries of fairyland.</p>

<div id="ip_8" class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;"><img src="images/i_011.jpg" width="401" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">PILATUS ABOVE A SEA OF CLOUDS.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
This first view, then, of the Vierwaldstättersee
from the quays at Lucerne&mdash;far more than the
first view of Lake Leman from the bridges of
Geneva, or of Zurich from the quays of Zurich
city&mdash;is dramatic in its complete and abrupt
transformation, in its turning upside-down, and
twisting inside-out, of all our previous conceptions
of our commonplace, workaday world!
The thing in a way is sensational, but sensational
within the modesty of nature, and certainly to
be enjoyed at least once in a lifetime, and
especially if one happen to be young. If one
happen to be older, or has seen the thing before,
there is reason good enough to quit the train at
Sursee, fifteen miles short of Lucerne, and
approach Lucerne thence gradually, on bicycle or
foot, by a zig-zag route of gradual introduction
that is pursued, I suppose, by hardly anyone, and
certainly not by Cook's tourist or Polytechnic
student, each of whom has borrowed Atalanta's
heels. Sursee itself, though entered by a medieval
gateway, has little else to show in the way of
particular antiquities. Yet the town itself, in
every lane and corner of it, is antiquity itself,
and altogether delightful in possession of local
colour. This is German Switzerland, and proclaims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
its Teutonic stamp at every turn: the
very gate by which we enter still bears above
its arch the double-headed eagle of the Holy
Roman Empire. From Sursee inquire your way
by the long ascent to the little upland town of
Beromünster, where a college for secular canons
was founded in the eleventh century. In
Murray's invaluable handbook, worth half a
dozen Baedekers, it is stated that "the church
is eleventh to twelfth century, though much
altered in the eighteenth century." The description
is misleading, for, though the core may be
really old, it is overlaid with later classical work
till most traces of medievalism are entirely
obscured&mdash;the very piers of the nave arcades
are monolithic shafts of pink marble. None the
less it is well worth visiting, for the sake of its
grand Renaissance choir stalls and sunny, silent
cloister. Hence to Sempach you may find a
pleasant, unfenced lane, through the open pastures
and apple-orchards, that falls by easy gradients
along the north shore of the placid lake.
Sempach is one of the sacred political sites of
Switzerland&mdash;like Morat, like Morgarten&mdash;for
here was fought, in 1386, one of those great
battles that vindicated her freedom, and linked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
her name for ever with England's as a synonym
for liberty:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Two Voices are there; one is of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of the mountains."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The legend of Arnold von Winkelried, like that
of Tell, has been questioned of recent years; it
first appears, more than half a century after the
supposed event, "in an interpolated notice in
a Zurich chronicle (1438 or later), and a popular
song of the latter half of the same century."
True or false it will bear retelling, and indicates
correctly enough the national spirit, even though
it err in narration of historical fact. After all,
most children know it by heart: how Arnold von
Winkelried, finding it impossible by any other
means to break the serried Austrian ranks,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"For victory shaped an open space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By gath'ring, with a wide embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into his single heart, a sheaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fatal Austrian spears."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Arnold is said to have come from Stans, where
his statue still stands in the market-place; where
his armour is still preserved in the Rathhaus; and
where it is certain at least that a family of the same
name was resident in the neighbourhood at the
time of the great fight. His house is also shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
on the skirts of the little town&mdash;or, more correctly,
may be found by those who seek it with much
diligence; for though the victory itself is not
forgotten in Switzerland, and was, indeed, celebrated
with much pomp at its quincentenary in
1886, it is hard to get lucid instructions in Stans
itself as to the whereabouts of the national hero's
birthplace, or even to authenticate its continued
existence. I found it at last&mdash;a little old farm
in the suburb, "of which one portion, including
a low archway with groined entrance and low
pillars, may be as old as the time of Winkelried."</p>

<p>Sempach itself, like Sursee, is a picturesque
old town, with another quaint old gateway. The
lake, though five miles long, is quite outside the
mountains, though the splintered crags of Pilatus
give a distant hint of Alpine splendour. The
remaining nine miles or so to Lucerne are perhaps
a trifle dull, and the entrance to the city is
through the usual straggling suburb&mdash;out of all
reasonable proportion to the place itself&mdash;that
conducts us too frequently to a town in Switzerland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>In France I always reckon that a town of less
than fifty thousand people is likely to retain
untouched its medieval character, or at any rate
its atmosphere of the sixteenth or seventeenth
century. Exceptions of course occur&mdash;I make
one in the case of Aix-en-Provence, which seems
to have been mostly rebuilt, though in very
delightful fashion, as late as the eighteenth
century. Mere modern watering-place growths,
again, like Biarritz or Vichy, must also be
eliminated&mdash;they had obviously no character to
lose. But apart from towns like these, my
general proposition will be acceptable, I think,
to anyone who dwells, on the one hand, on
places like Beauvais, or Cambrai, or Chartres, or,
on the other, on bigger cities, such as Angers,
or Orleans, or Tours. In Switzerland, which
appears to me, much more than France, to be
bursting with prosperity and redundant population,
it seems on the whole harder to suggest
a general rule. Neuchâtel, for example, with
twenty-five thousand people, is virtually a handsome
modern town. Berne, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
with a population of over ninety thousand,
preserves its ancient aspect in remarkable degree.
Luckily Lucerne, in a middle position, with
a population of forty-one-odd thousand souls,
leans more to the example of Berne than to that
of Neuchâtel or Lausanne. The immediate
front to the lake, of course, just as at Geneva,
is blatantly new of mode&mdash;it is largely, in fact, a
conglomerate of palatial modern hotels. But
immediately behind&mdash;immediately you quit the
broad sweep of quays and promenades, and
plunge almost anywhere at random into the network
of ancient streets&mdash;you are able to forget at
once, whether you linger in the shadow of the
fifteenth-century church of the Bare-foot Friars
(the Barfüsserkirche, or Church of the Franciscans);
or bask in open sunlight on the narrow
quay, at the back of the sixteenth-century
Rathhaus, by the side of the green and rushing
Reuss; or climb the steep pitch of hill behind
the town to the line of ancient walls, with their
long line of stately watch-towers (like those at
Fribourg and Morat) that stretches with so
much picturesque dignity across the base of the
blunt angle&mdash;so blunt as scarcely to be an angle
at all&mdash;between the river and the lake; or seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
shelter from the glare in the long galleries of the
two old wooden bridges, with their mellow
red-tiled roofs, that manage to survive across the
river&mdash;plunge, I repeat, where you will into
this labyrinth of old thoroughfares, with their
plastered and painted house-fronts, and gaily
splashing fountains in courts and corners, and
broad eaves that project far across the street, and
you are reminded at every step, not of the
modern tourist resort of world-wide reputation
that is visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists
every year, but of that old Lucerne that grew up
gradually round the Benedictine monastery that
was founded here in the year 750, or thereabouts,
by the abbots of Murbach in Alsace, and that
gets its name from that St. Leodegar, or Leger,
who was patron of the monastery. The monks
gave way to a college of secular canons in
1455. Unhappily, of the old collegiate church
there are virtually no remains. The twin west
spires, indeed, date from the beginning of the
sixteenth century, and are good Flamboyant
Gothic; but the body of the existing building
was erected after a fire in 1633&mdash;the date is on
the west doorway&mdash;and is purely Classical, though
quite a good example of its particular style and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
date. Correspondingly late is the woodwork
inside, including the fine stalls in the choir.
Other points of interest will be found by those
who seek for them: the panels of old glass (one
is dated 1650); the ironwork and carving of the
great west door; and the two richly sculptured
reredoses at the ends of the two aisles, one of
which has a Pietà, and one a Death of the Virgin.
Even more remarkable is the stately, classical
cloister that encompasses the whole church like
an Italian Santo Campo. All is very splendid,
yet all would be gladly surrendered in exchange
for what the relentless flames devoured in 1633.
The one is a work of the completed Renaissance&mdash;learned,
correct, and conscious, but perhaps a
trifle cold. The other, we may be certain,
though it may have presented to the critic a
thousand faults of detail, whispered at least from
its dim aisles and chapels "the last enchantments
of the Middle Age." The one is the laborious
product of the textbook and the studio; the other
the inevitable offspring of a vigorous and vital
art. The one is the clever expression of an
individual talent; the other the collective offering
of a people's enthusiasm and faith.</p>

<div id="ip_16" class="figcenter" style="width: 367px;"><img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="367" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE OLD BRIDGE WITH SHRINE, LUCERNE.</div></div>

<p>The Hofkirche, then, may be entered casually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
examined superficially, and quitted without
regret. Time will be better spent in lingering
on the old wooden foot-bridges that still span the
green and insurgent Reuss at some little distance
below its exit from the lake. Formerly there
were three; but the longest&mdash;the old Hof-brücke&mdash;was
sacrificed in 1852 to the passion for
spurious improvement. Of the two that survive,
the Kapell-Brücke is by far the most important,
and apparently gets its name from the old
St. Peter's Chapel on the north shore of the river,
to which it leads diagonally across the clear and
voluminous stream. In actual touch with this,
but nearer the southern shore, rises the picturesque
old Wasserturm, which is said once to have
served as a lighthouse (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lucerna</i>), and to have
given Lucerne its name. The Premonstratensian
Abbey of La Lucerne, near Avranches, in
Normandy, is stated in Joanne's handbook to have
got its title from the same source; but the Swiss
Lucerne is perhaps better derived (I do not
profess to understand by what strange process of
corruption) from the name of its patron,
Leodegar. Anyhow, this old Water-Tower is a
decidedly striking object, and conspicuous in
most photographs and pictures of Lucerne, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
its typical octagonal cap. Both the two old
wooden bridges, as is common in Switzerland,
are protected from the weather by open timber
roofs; and inserted in the framing of these last
is a series of eighteenth-century paintings, representing,
in the case of the Kapell-Brücke, scenes
from the history of the city, and from the lives
of its patronal saints, St. Mauritius and St.
Leodegar; and in the case of the lesser Spreuer,
or Mühlen, Brücke a late, post-medieval representation
of the grim, medieval humours of the
ghastly Dance of Death. This strange <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">memento
mori</i> was a favourite morality of the Middle
Time; Death in the form of a skeleton (Wordsworth's
"Death the Skeleton") presents himself
in turn to all kinds and conditions of men&mdash;in
the great series at the old abbey church of La
Chaise-Dieu (Haute-Loire) in France to actually
not less than thirty-five, now setting his foot
with timid determination on the trailing robe of
a sacrosanct Pope; now greeting with mocking
glance a Cardinal, who averts his head with
hasty terror; now dancing with insolent
familiarity in front of an aged man; now laying
his bony grasp on a troubadour, who lets his
mandoline clatter to the ground in access of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
sudden fear. These are subjects depicted at La
Chaise-Dieu; but just the same spirit of gruesome
raillery inspires the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">danse macabre</i> wherever
found:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Le pauvre en sa chaumière où le chaume le courve<br /></span>

<span class="i2">N'en défend pas nos rois."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">At Hexham there are still four paintings on
panel, representing Death with a Pope, an
Emperor, a King, and a Cardinal. Browning

Venice how</p>

</div>

<p class="in0">but the Death of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">danse macabre</i> at Hexham,
as perhaps always, so far from stepping tacitly, is
a grinning and grisly contortionist, writhing his
repulsive anatomy into a dozen different shapes
of derision. The victims alone have dignity,
whilst Death is merely the jester or buffoon.
Different, indeed, is the shadowy Death of the
Apocrypha&mdash;"And I saw, and behold, a pale
horse, and he that sat upon him, his name was
Death"; or the mysterious, shrouded, blood-sprinkled
figure (to couple small images with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
great) of the Masque of the Red Death. These
particular paintings at Lucerne are necessarily
small in scale, and perhaps not very legible in
the dim recesses of the roof. I have never had
the patience to decipher them, nor do they
perhaps conform, since so unusually late in date,
to the stereotyped convention of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries.</p>

<p>There is just one other spot in Lucerne which
ought not to be neglected, and this, though
sufficiently far removed from Death in his merely
antic aspect&mdash;from the Death of "graves, of
worms, and epitaphs"&mdash;has also to do with
Death in his nobler guise, for it is the monument
of the twenty-six Swiss officers, and seven
hundred and sixty Swiss Guards, who fell in
defending the Tuileries and their King on
August 10, 1792. "Honour to you, brave
men," writes Carlyle, "honourable pity, through
long times! Not martyrs were ye; and yet
almost more. He was no King of yours, this
Louis; and he forsook you like a King of shreds
and patches; ye were but sold to him for some
poor sixpence a day; yet would ye work for
your wages, keep your plighted word. The
work now was to die; and ye did it." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
monument is fitly a lion, and was hewn out by
Lukas Ahorn of Constance, after the model of
Thorwaldsen, from a face of living rock; he is
pierced by a broken lance and already at point of
death, one paw hangs forward limp and helpless,
but the other, with claws outstretched, still
clutches and guards the Bourbon lilies&mdash;a monument
of faithfulness to death. The attitude and
face of the great lion, "having the most touching
expression of broken strength, subdued pain, and
courageous self-surrender," are both very grandly
conceived. It is sad indeed that the rock itself,
though the sculpture is boarded up to protect it
from winter frosts, is badly cracked in more than
one direction. Closely adjacent to this fine
monument, and certainly worth a visit, is the
very curious Gletscher Garten, with its wonderful
"pot-holes," or "glacier-mills," some of
which retain their "mill-stones" still in situ.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Looking eastward from the quays or the lake at
Lucerne across the shining expanses of water
to the great background of snow-clad Alps&mdash;visualizing
those Alps in memory as we sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
later on at home, by the side of a winter fire&mdash;most
of us have probably an impression only
of a very lovely, and very magnificent, but also
very vague and inchoate, huddle of confused and
indefinite hills. The highest peak seen at
Lucerne from the Schweizerhof Quay is apparently
the Tödi (11,887 feet), supreme at the
point, or very nearly at the point, where Uri,
Glarus, and the Grisons meet, and next to this
in actual dignity is perhaps the snowy Titlis
(10,627 feet), which rises above Engelberg, and
also belongs, like the Tödi, to a bunch of three
converging cantons&mdash;in this case Uri, Unterwalden,
and Berne. Yet these two giants, with
their groups of attendant satellites, are so remote
from the margin of the lake itself, and so lost
amidst the company of their hardly less magnificent
peers, that they strike one on the whole
with less impress of overwhelming individuality&mdash;associate
themselves on the whole less easily
with our necessarily blurred and imperfect
recollections of the Vierwaldstättersee when the
lake itself is no longer seen&mdash;than two other
striking hills of far less elevation, and in one case
of far less noble outline, that yet rear themselves
more immediately from the exact levels of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
lake, and that stand more or less aloof, in
conspicuous isolation, not merely from one
another, but from the general confraternity of
hills. Wordsworth reminds us in an admirable
sonnet how</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Pelion and Ossa flourished side by side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together in immortal books enrolled"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">yet surely not Pelion and Ossa (I have never seen
them) dominate Thessaly more insistently, or
confront one another with more marked and
divergent character across the intervening valley,
than Swiss Rigi and Pilatus confront one another
across the blue spaces of the Lake of the Four
Forest Cantons, or dominate its waters from the
exact margin of its shores!</p>

<div id="ip_23" class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;"><img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="421" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">OLD HOUSES AND BRIDGE AT LUCERNE</div></div>

<p>Of these mountain twins of central Switzerland,
Pilatus is by far the more imposing, not merely
in point of elevation&mdash;the Rigi is less by a
thousand feet&mdash;and immeasurably in grace of
peaked and rocky outline, but also in wealth
of legendary lore, and even of actual historical
significance. Of legend, because Pontius Pilate,
according to one account, smitten with remorse
after the crucifixion of Our Saviour, ascended
these lonely summits in the course of his miserable
wanderings, and drowned himself here in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
little pool (which is now dried up) on the
Bründlen Alp, which lies on the less well-known
slopes of the hill descending from the highest
peak, or Tomlishorn (6,995 feet), in the direction
of the Rumligbach. According, however, to
another version, which first appears in the pages
of Eusebius, Pontius Pilate committed suicide
at Rome; and it was only after a series of
strange vicissitudes and wanderings, recalling,
though less hallowed than, those of the body
of St. Cuthbert, that his corpse was flung at last,
like so much carrion, into this little mountain
tarn. First it was thrown into the Tiber, but
the evil spirit could not rest, and storms and
floods that fell upon Rome necessitated its
removal to Vienne, near Lyons, where again
it found watery burial in the Rhone. Vienne,
however, was now visited in turn by commotions
like those at Rome; the Lake of Geneva, the
next place of interment, proved equally infelicitous;
and it was only finally in untrodden
solitudes, beneath the grey limestone peaks of
the Frackmünd (or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fractus Mons</i>), that the
hateful body, which earth refused to receive
in peace, was suffered at last to hide itself in
uneasy but permanent sepulchre. For "even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
here the wicked spirit could not rest from evil-doing.
Storm and rain enveloped the mountain,
the lake burst its banks, Alps were ruined, and
herds swept away. At last a travelling scholar
confronted the ghost, and by his magic forced
him to accept a pact by which, on condition
of one day's freedom, he was to remain at rest
for the remainder of the year. The bargain was
kept. The land was at peace, but yearly on
Good Friday any shepherd who approached the
haunted tarn saw, seated on a throne of rock
above the water, a terrible figure clad in the red
robes of magistracy." One would hasten to suppose
that the story had been invented in explanation
of the name; but the name Pilatus (perhaps
from <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pileatus</i>, the capped mountain, from its
well-known cloud-compelling qualities) is said
to date only from the eighteenth century, whilst
the story is at least as old as the fourteenth.</p>

<div id="ip_25" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="600" height="383" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE SEVEN TOWERS, LOOKING OVER LUCERNE FROM THE GUTSCH.</div></div>

<p>So far the realm of legend. The realm of
actual history is scarcely less astonishing, and
attaches itself to legend by imperceptible ties.
It is history that the city of Lucerne in the
Middle Ages did actually prohibit the ascent
of the mysterious hill: it is history that six
priests in 1307 were condemned to several months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
of imprisonment for daring to visit the forbidden
lake. The legend of the pact with the travelling
scholar had at least one important variant, for
it was believed that by throwing a stone into
the pool the spirit could be at any time provoked,
and his evil influence set free to work havoc
on lake and fell. It was to avert this constant
menace at the hands of audacity, or scepticism,
that the city fathers promulgated the law by
which access to the hill was prohibited. It was
only with the Renaissance, and with the birth of
the new spirit of rationalism, that the old beliefs
became untenable, and that the old terrors were
rendered empty&mdash;as Gareth cleaves the helm
of the silent terror that</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Names himself the Night and oftener Death,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and reveals inside "the bright face of a blooming
boy." The terrors were already grown more
than a little threadbare when Conrad Gesner, the
naturalist, ascended the mountain in 1555; they
must nearly have vanished altogether in another
thirty years, when the Curé of Lucerne, "before
a crowd of witnesses, flung stones and rubbish
into the lake without raising anything more than
a ripple." At the bottom, however, of all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
wild stories there is a substratum of truth, for
Pilatus is really a great brewer of storms, and the
peasants of the neighbourhood still prognosticate
the weather from the disposition of the clouds
upon its summit. Thus Roseberry Topping, in
Cleveland, or what greedy iron-masters have left
of it, was supposed as long ago as the time of
Camden to foretell the coming storm:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"If Roseberry Topping wears a cap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Cleveland then beware of a clap."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Roseberry and Pilatus are in other respects
curiously analogous; each is of a typically peaked
appearance; and each is situated on the extreme
edge of the hill group to which it belongs.
Pilatus, it may be noted, is now ascended by a railway,
and thus heaps of "unappreciative trippers"
are now lightly conveyed every fine summer day
to the once weirdly mysterious summit, to which
the medieval climber won only surreptitiously,
and perhaps in awe and terror. It is surely the
anti-climax of unromantic common sense.</p>

<p>The Rigi, which confronts Pilatus across the
lake in such startling dissimilarity, is perhaps the
most popular hill in Europe, and is certainly in a
sense the most vulgar. It is bad enough that a
hill should be desecrated by a single mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
railway: it is intolerable that it should be
degraded by three! How many people ascend
to the Rigi Kulm on a day of tolerable weather
in August from either Vitznau or Arth-Goldau
one would hardly dare to guess; how many are
housed at night in one or other of the monster
hotels&mdash;at Rigi Kulm, at Rigi Kaltbad, at Rigi
Staffel, at Rigi Scheidegg&mdash;that oppress and burden
its weary summits is a matter not to be dwelt on.
This is not the place to attempt a dissertation
on the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quæstio vexata</i> of mountain railways. To
the writer (who is prejudiced) the thing seems
axiomatic: all that goes to make up mountain
grandeur, all that is of the spirit,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Of eye and ear&mdash;both what they half create,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what perceive"&mdash;<br /></span>

to a mere elevated mass of <span class="locked">matter&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">is gone in a moment when you thus strip a hill of
its proper attributes&mdash;of its mystery, of its remoteness,
of its difficulty of access; and there remains
nothing save bulk, which you get in the Great
Pyramid; and prospect, which you get from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Eiffel Tower; and a clever bit of engineering
(diabolically clever), which is just as well got in
the Great Wheel at Kensington. Yet frankly it
must be confessed that if something had to be
sacrificed to gratify the sensation-mongers, and
the lazy, and the impotent, the Rigi might best
be immolated. Just this one hill, perhaps, might
be spared: but was it necessary to bind to the
horns of the altar every other hill of medium
size in Switzerland&mdash;the Niesen, and the Brienzer,
Rothhorn, and the Schynige Platte, and the
Beatenberg; to say nothing, on the shores of
Lake Lucerne itself, in addition to the Rigi, of
the Burgenstock, and Pilatus, and the Stanserhorn;
and elsewhere in Switzerland of the deeper crime
of the Jungfrau, and in Savoy of the crowning
infamy of Mont Blanc?</p>

<p>The Rigi, in fact, owing to its peculiar configuration
and structure, is less hurt by this
eruption of mountain railways than any other
mountain in the Alps. The hill is really a whole
agglomeration of hills&mdash;of which the Rigi Kulm
(5,905 feet) is merely the culminating summit&mdash;which
occupy very roughly the rectangular area
that lies between the lakes of Lucerne, Zug, and
Lowerz, and are formed largely of horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
layers of red conglomerate, or pudding-stone,
rock. The hill is thus distinctly of the lumpy
type of mountain, as opposed to its rival, Pilatus,
which belongs to the vertical, or peaked; and
owes what beauty it possesses to its long bands
of ruddy precipice, down which dangle short
spouts of more or less exiguous cascade, and to
the solemn masses of dark wood that gird its
middle flanks. The towering crags of Pilatus,
like tongues of shivering flame, have here no
rival in these long, parallel belts of forest, rock,
and open lawn, that rise above the lake in stately
tier above tier, and are hardly wilder at their
summits than along the margin of the lake:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It is not difficult among glades like these for a
mountain railway to worm its way obscurely, and
to hide its ugly presence beneath the garment of
thick woods.</p>

<div id="ip_30" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="600" height="376" alt="" /><div class="caption">LOOKING ACROSS THE LAKE.</div></div>

<p>It is the fashion to spend the night on the
Rigi, and to witness the sunrise next day. The
writer has done it once, but the experience was
disappointing: it was already broad daylight,
and the whole landscape was already coldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
visible, when the little group of shivering penitents
was marshalled on the summit to watch
the up-burst of a sun that itself seemed cold and
grey. It may be better worth the trouble if one
rises for actual daybreak, or when the sun issues
forth more royally from his chamber in the east.
On the whole, perhaps, it is better to avoid the
Rigi in its stereotyped sensational aspects, and to
investigate its secret&mdash;for secret to yield it
assuredly has&mdash;unconventionally, and out of the
season. I have crossed its saddle from Goldau
to Weggis, between the Rigi Rotstock and the
Schild, during the later days of March, when the
track by which I climbed was still white with
virgin snow. This was, in fact, the old pilgrim
path by which devotees once ascended&mdash;may
possibly still ascend&mdash;to worship at the little
upland chapel (rebuilt in 1715&ndash;21) of Our Lady
of the Snow ("Maria zum Schnee"). This
shrine is the centre of a little colony, the oldest
and quaintest of all that have developed on the
Rigi; and just because it lies in a hollow of the
summit peaks, and commands no distant views,
has escaped the bitter ravages of modern exploitation.
The spot is called Rigi Klösterli,
because inhabited all the year round by a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
group of Capuchin friars from the community at
Arth, who dwell in the little hospice and serve
the little chapel. This was an old centre for
goat-whey cure, and the inns are delightfully old-fashioned
of aspect; the whole appearance of the
spot, indeed, is full of local character, whereas
most other settlements on the Rigi are cosmopolitan
and commonplace. The salvation of the
place is its utter lack of view: you must scramble
up steep grass slopes, towards the south, to the
summit of the saddle, to enlarge your horizon in
a few steps from a barrier of green hill-side to a
prospect so vast that you seem suddenly to have
before you all the kingdoms of the earth and the
glory thereof. I do not know, indeed, that the
actual range of view is greater than that commanded
in France from the top of the Puy-de
<span class="locked">Dôme&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="iq">"Si Dôme était sur Dôme<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and certainly it is not so majestic as many more
restricted views of particular groups of Alps,
seen&mdash;as mountain views are almost always seen
to best advantage&mdash;from the slopes, or from the
summits, of lesser hills. But except from the
marble roofs of Milan Cathedral there is perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
no other generally recognized and easily accessible
point of view from which it is possible, merely
by turning the head, to command so long a line
of crowding Alpine summits, extending from the
Sentis, in the extreme east, to Pilatus in the
west, for a distance of roughly one hundred and
twenty <span class="locked">miles&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">Yet here, when we stand on the crest in unaccustomed
solitude in the first stirrings of the
spring, when the giant hotels are still mostly
shut and empty, and when the high-level railway
between the Kaltbad and the Scheidegg is

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Of the five great primary divisions of the
Vierwaldstättersee&mdash;and one is driven, however
anxious to preserve the configuration of the
cross, to recognize a fifth, and separate, division
in the Bay, or Lake, of Uri&mdash;of the five great
divisions of the Lake of Lucerne, that which
extends to the quays of Lucerne itself is the most
placid and domestic in respect of actual shore-line.
True, there is always a background of
lofty mountain, sufficiently magnificent and
sufficiently near at hand to impress itself on the
landscape as a component, and even dominant,
feature; but the actual littoral in this compartment
of the lake&mdash;and Lucerne, unlike Zurich or
Geneva, but to some extent like Como, is
literally partitioned into compartments&mdash;is softly
arcadian in character, with low, gently swelling
hills of slight, inconclusive contour, knee-deep
with hay and flowers, and shoulder-deep with
apple-blossom and orchard. Next, I think, in
ascending scale is the Bay of Küsnacht, so called
from the big village at its head. The north-west
shore of this is again of mildly pastoral character;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
but directly from its south-east margin rise the
deep, dark woods of the Rigi, supplying that
hint of real Alpine sublimity&mdash;it is still merely a
hint&mdash;that is wholly absent from the immediate
shores of the little Lucernersee strictly so-called.
The road from Lucerne to Küsnacht, where it
skirts this bay beyond the big, scrambling village
of Meggen, is one of the pleasantest view-points
within easy touch of Lucerne whence to enjoy
across the water the noble mountain background
that screens the south shore of the main lake.
On a mild spring evening, when this splendid
landscape is an ætherialized study in black and
white; when the snowflakes and cowslips are
pushing up in thousands through the quickly
growing grass; when the host of margent rushes
scarcely quivers in the stillness; and when the
opposite mountains are reflected without a ripple
in the calm and silent lake, it is hard to believe
that all this exquisite beauty, which seems so
unearthly and unexplored, is really the much
boasted, much advertised, much visited "Lovely
Lucerne"&mdash;it is difficult to realize that the paddle
of a steamer ever churns this unruffled mirror, or
that the harsh whistle of the ascending locomotive
ever wakes the echoes on steadfast Rigi. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
who visit Lucerne only in the deadly oppression
of the high season, when every lake-side quay
swarms like an ant-hill, and every village rings
like Babel, are apt to carry away wrong impressions
of this still absolutely unimpaired lake.
The playground at seasons is densely packed, but
the place has received no permanent wrong;
those who can reconcile Nature and a crowd will
be happy here even in August, when</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p class="in0">will easily find solace here in early spring, or late
autumn, when the place is like a desert. No one
has done the place a permanent wrong. Who
can claim as much for the holly steeps of
Windermere&mdash;for the distorted Clarens shore of
Lake Geneva?</p>

<p>Küssnacht itself is a large, typically Swiss,
village, at the foot of the low pass&mdash;yet altogether
too low to be dignified by the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
pass&mdash;that at this point intervenes between the
basins of Zug and Lucerne. The place has this
significance, that here for the first time, as we
perambulate the lake, we encounter spots associated
with the legend of William Tell. I
suppose one must call it legend, and concede so
much to the "higher critics," though Ruskin's
clarion anger rings loud and clear. "A sort of
triumphant shriek, like all the railway whistles
going off at once at Clapham Junction, has gone
up from the Fooldom of Europe at the destruction
of the myth of William Tell. To us, every
word of it was true&mdash;but mythically luminous
with more than mortal truth.... The myth
of William Tell is destroyed forsooth? and you
have tunnelled Gothard and filled, maybe, the
Bay of Uri&mdash;and it was all for you and your sake
that the grapes dropped blood from the press of
St. Jacob, and the pine-club struck down horse
and helm in Morgarten glen?" If the history of
William Tell itself is unauthentic, we must not
demand authenticity for its visible memorials and
sites. Gesler's Castle above Küssnacht&mdash;or the
fragments that remain of it&mdash;certainly never
belonged to Gesler; whilst the chapel at the
head of the Hohle Gasse, or Hollow Way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
was certainly rebuilt in 1644, and did not exist at
all at the end of the fifteenth century. This is
the traditional spot where Tell, after escaping
from the boat at the Tellsplatte, and running by
way of Schwyz and the back of the Rigi, waited
for Gesler on his return from Altdorf, and shot
him dead with his terrible cross-bow before he
could reach his castle-gate at Küssnacht. It is
worth the traveller's while to press on a mile or
two further in the direction of Arth, though this
is to exchange the basin of the lake of Lucerne
for that of the lake of Zug. The Zugersee lies
almost at once beneath us, at a slightly lower
level (roughly sixty feet) than the Vierwaldstättersee,
and altogether of more placid and softer
character&mdash;a pleasant thing to look at in the
tender evening light, with its shore line embowered
amidst orchards and deep rich meadows,
and dotted in every direction with peaceful farms,
but destitute of mountain grandeur, save immediately
towards its head, where the dark forests of
the Rigi, towards the west, and of the Rossberg,
towards the east, open a gloomy "Gate of the
hills," beyond which, though really above Schwyz
and the little lake of Lowerz, the tall, bare rock
pyramids of the Great and Little Mitre (Gross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
and Kleine Mythen) tower up in cleft magnificence
above the cradle of Swiss freedom.</p>

<p>As to the story of William Tell, this, alas!
has gone the way of our own tales of Robin
Hood (whom Mr. Sydney Lee dismisses as a
"mythical forest elf") and his Merry Men of
Sherwood Forest. The legend first appears in
the manuscript "Weisses Buch," so-called from
its white binding, that is still preserved at Sarnen,
and which was written between 1467 and 1476;
and in the poem called the "Tellenlied," which
dates from about 1474. Tell, however, is
supposed to have lived at about the commencement
of the fourteenth century. There are
certainly some scraps of evidence that suggest in
combination that the later Tell myth (as, for that
matter, are presumably most myths) is based on
some substratum of solid historical fact. Thus,
there is said to be evidence that a religious observance
of some kind was instituted in connection
with Tell in the place where he lived in 1387; and
it is stated, though not earlier than 1504, that
a chapel was erected on the Tellsplatte, as the
country people believed in commemoration of the
landing there of William Tell, in 1388. The
story as now commonly reported&mdash;that Tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
refused to do obeisance to the Austrian Arch-duke's
cap at Altdorf; that he shot the apple off
his son's head at the brutal bidding of Gesler in
the market-place of the same town; that he
afterwards escaped from Austrian custody by
springing from the boat to the shore at the
Tellsplatte during the onset of a sudden squall;
and that he shot the tyrant through the heart as
the latter neared his castle hall at Küssnacht&mdash;first
assumed its present form, in which it has
been dramatized by Schiller, at the hands of
Tschudi of Glarus, in the first half of the
sixteenth century. Even as early, however, as the
close of this same century the very existence of
William Tell had been questioned by Guilmann
in his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Rebus Helveticis</i>. Voltaire was duly
sceptical as to the story of the boy and the apple
("l'histoire de la pomme est bien suspecte");
but the patriotic faith of Canton Uri was still
sufficiently strong at the close of the eighteenth
century to consign to the flames at the hand of
the public hangman the sceptical "Guillaume
Tell; fable danoise." The result, however, as
expressed curtly in Murray's handbook, is that
Tell has been banished from authentic history.
Exactly similar legends or sagas of the tenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
century are found in Norway, Denmark, Iceland,
Holstein, and on the Rhine; and our Clym of
the Clough shoots at an apple on his son's <span class="locked">head&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"But Cloudesle cleft the apple in two,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">His son he did not nee'."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Thus William Tell, like Arnold von Winkelried,
recedes into the dim borderland of legend and
history. After all, it is no irreparable loss. The
individual Arnold, the individual Tell, were units
merely of the great company of authentic,
unnamed heroes who smote the Austrian tyrant at
Sempach and Morgarten, who triumphed against
the Burgundian at Grandson, Morat, and Nancy.</p>

<p>The third division, in still ascending scale of
mountain grandeur, of the Lake of the Four
Forest Cantons is that which extends south-westward
from the intersection of the cross,
and is known&mdash;certainly towards its extremity,
and perhaps throughout its length&mdash;from the
little village at its head as the Lake of Alpnach.
Here the general effect is more definitely
mountainous than that which has awaited us
in sailing the two previous compartments: Rigi
is now exchanged for Pilatus as the presiding
genius and dominant monarch of the scene;
whilst the Alps of Unterwalden, and, beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the low pass of the Brünig, the greater Alps
of the Berner Oberland&mdash;the triple Maiden,
Monk, and Giant&mdash;the Peak of Storms, and the
Peak of Shrieking&mdash;at last supply that mountain
background which everyone must have missed
when looking up the water towards Küssnacht
or Lucerne. The Oberland giants, it is true, are
set at too great distance to impress the eye,
however much they may affect the imagination,
with the same sense of impending mountain
majesty as we find in the Bay of Uri; but Pilatus
and the Stanserhorn are both immediate and
splendid objects; whilst even the dark, pine-clad
crags of the little Bürgenstock, which is
literally, like Catullus' Sermio, "all-but-island"&mdash;for
it needs but the raising of the lake a very few
feet, and the consequent flooding of the low
isthmus between Stans and Buochs, to complete
its insulation&mdash;push out into the lake with an
assertive individuality that is wholly out of
keeping with their relatively insignificant height
(actually less than four thousand feet). Roughly
half-way up, at a point where the lake is narrowed
to the dimensions of a river by the sudden, sharp
intrusion of the tall black cliffs of the Lopperberg
(a footstool of Pilatus), the strait thus strangely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
created is spanned across to Stanstad by an ugly
iron bridge. The crass utilitarianism, in fact,
that mars, though it cannot wholly disfigure,
so much that is beautiful in Switzerland, and that
contributes so little to the honour of the modern
Switzer (however well it may fill his purse),
is altogether painfully too evident along the
shores of this division of the Lake of Lucerne.
The hideous lines of electric wires along the
margin of the lake are only less detestable than
those that degrade the Pass of Llanberis; this
bridge across the narrows is as ugly as may be;
whilst Baedeker (with his usual businesslike lack
of romanticism) duly chronicles in a single breath
the presence of "water-falls and Portland cement
factories" in the neighbouring glen of the
Rotzloch.</p>

<div id="ip_43" class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;"><img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="410" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">PILATUS FROM STANSTAD.</div></div>

<p>The visitor is now fairly landed in the state of
Unterwalden, the second most mountainous and
romantic of the Four Forest Cantons. The Swiss
have solved to perfection the problem of Home
Rule: here is a little territory of less than two
hundred square miles, and with a population
in 1900 of less than thirty thousand people
(less than that of Peterborough), which is yet,
for all domestic intents and purposes, an independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
sovereign state. Nay, not content with this,
since these thirty thousand odd people, on their
odd two hundred miles of mountain-land, were ill-content
to dwell together in amity, the state
is actually sub-divided, like Bâle and Appenzell,
into two independent halves. Each of these
is confined mostly to a single big valley, with
its tributaries; and each has a capital that would
hardly pass muster in the mill districts of
Lancashire and Yorkshire for a fair-sized village.
The half-canton of Obwalden is thus roughly
conterminous with the valley of the Obwalden
Aa, and has Sarnen, on the great highroad from
Lucerne to Meiringen across the Brünig, for
its rustic metropolis, whilst Nidwalden comprises
most of the valley of the Nidwalden Aa, and
finds its seat of government at Stans. Both these
valleys, though largely sub-Alpine (the head
of the Nidwalden Aa alone pierces deep into
the heart of the greater hills, in the neighbourhood
of Engelberg), are full of lovely scenery,
though perhaps apt to be neglected by the too
impatient tourist in his eagerness for the greater
glories of Uri and the Bernese Highlands. It
is pleasant, again, after so much destructive
historical criticism, to encounter traces in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
valleys of a less widely recognized Swiss hero,
whose services to his country, if less dramatic
than those of Tell and von Winkelried, are at
any rate more authentic, and perhaps of wider
import. Nicolas von der Flüe has found no
niche in popular school histories, has evoked
no "Battle of the Books," and has inspired no
great national drama. None the less his mild
personality appears with high significance at
a tremulously critical period in the evolution of
Swiss unity and Swiss independence. Whether
or not we accept the story of the famous meeting
on the Rütli, it is certain that the foundations
of free Switzerland were laid in August, 1291,
by the perpetual alliance, for the maintenance
of their ancient rights and liberties, of the three
Cantons of Uri, Unterwalden, and Schwyz.</p>

<div id="ip_45" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" width="600" height="405" alt="" /><div class="caption">LOOKING UP THE LAKE, FROM BECKENRIED.</div></div>

<p>This is the stock whence has sprung the present
Confederation of twenty-two free states; but the
stock nearly perished at the root from a little
worm of discord in 1481, when the Confederates
quarrelled at Stans over the admission to the
Union (which then already numbered eight
members) of the towns of Fribourg and Neuchâtel,
and perhaps also over the division of the spoil that
they had lately wrung from Charles the Bold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
The Diet had already debated for three days, and
had broken up on the evening of the third with
what seemed little chance of peace: the morrow
threatened secession, and most likely civil war.
Nicolas von der Flüe (often called affectionately
Bruder Klaus; his real name was Löwenbrugger)
was born at Flühli, where the Melch Thal joins
the Aa valley, in 1417; and after many years of
active life, including some experience of war,
retired, in about his fiftieth year, to a hermitage
in the gorge of the river a few minutes' walk
distant from his native village, where he is said to
have subsisted solely on the Sacramental Wafer, of
which he partook once a month. He died in 1487,
and was afterwards beatified, and in the course of
last century, sainted. It so happened that his
Confessor in 1481 was the head parish priest of
Stans, a certain Heini Ingrund; who, early in the
morning of the day succeeding the break-up of
the Diet, sought out Nicolas in his hermitage, and
obtained from him a message to the deputies
urging reconciliation and peace. Armed with
this exhortation he then hastened back to Stans,
where he arrived, as we are told, all wet with
perspiration, and hurriedly made the round of the
inns where the deputies were still lodged, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
prevailed on them, by his tears and entreaties, to
meet yet once again in consultation to hear the
secret message of Brother Klaus. The words of
this are not reported, but its effect was immediate
and startling; in less than an hour the irreconcilables
were reconciled; and the morning, which
rose so gloomily with presage of disaster and
dissolution, finally resulted in greater strength and
union, as ratified in the Convention of Stans. A
picture was painted by command of the government
of Nidwalden, and may still be seen in a
passage in the Rathhaus at Stans. It is curiously
unhistorical in character, for Nicolas is here
represented as appearing before the Diet in person,
whereas nothing is better attested than that
he merely sent a messenger of peace. Stans
itself has other points of interest; the house of
Arnold von Winkelried has been already alluded
to; and there is a statue of the hero in the
middle of the market-place, and another, with a
fountain, near the church. Like most little towns
in this part of Switzerland&mdash;like Sarnen, Arth, and
Altdorf&mdash;the place is delightfully quaint and old-fashioned,
with its often painted houses, and its
wide-projecting eaves. Above it towers the
Stanserhorn, with perhaps more bulk than shape;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
whilst a mile or two down the valley, on the
opposite shore of the lake, the graceful peaks of
Pilatus give a welcome note of contrast. The
church has a Romanesque tower; but the body,
like most of those in the Alps, is Classical rebuilding.
In the graveyard, however, stands the
medieval bone-house, which, like others in the
neighbourhood, is a separate and complete little
church. The bones have been removed, and
perhaps decently interred; but a tablet on the
exterior still testifies to the appalling slaughter
here of the people of Nidwalden&mdash;women and
children, as well as men&mdash;to the number of more
than four hundred, by the savage French
Republicans in 1798. This frightful massacre at
the hands of a brutal soldiery, infuriated by long
resistance, lacked no circumstance of <span class="locked">horror&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">that, after the lapse of another century, may
rival the German triumphs in Belgium. The
visitor will find himself repaid by prolonging his
adventure up the valley of the Nidwalden Aa to
the upland vale of Engelberg, where still stands the
famous Benedictine monastery that was founded
circa 1120, and that received its present name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
("Mons Angelorum," or Hill of Angels) at the
hands of Pope Calixtus II., from the tradition,
celebrated by Wordsworth in some feeble lines in
1820, that the site was pointed out by angel songs.
Roughly half-way up the valley is the village of
Wolfenschiessen, hard by whose parish church is
the little wooden house, or hermitage, that was
inhabited by the hermit, Conrad Scheuber (1480&ndash;1559),
a grandson of Nicolas von der Flüe. This
was built on the mountain pastures of the Bettelirüt,
high above Wolfenschiessen, in 1547; and
was transplanted to its present site in 1867. On
the hermitage, or church&mdash;I foolishly seem to
have made no note on the spot, and my recollection
is misty&mdash;is a series of naïve paintings,
representing scenes from the life of the hermit,
and showing him engaged (unless I mistake) in
the congenial medieval hermit-task of outwitting,
or otherwise discomforting, a very material devil,
or devils.</p>

<div id="ip_49" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="600" height="413" alt="" /><div class="caption">BECKENRIED.</div></div>

<p>Sarnen, the capital of Obwalden, is situated at
the north end of its lake of the same name, and
is as interesting in its way as its rival Stans; but
the green pastoral valley of the Obwalden Aa,
though everywhere bordered by lofty hills, is
altogether more open and less rugged than its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Nidwalden namesake, and terminates, unlike the
latter, in the gentle pass of the Brünig, instead of
the lofty, snow-clad summits of the Spannörter
and Titlis. High above the little mountain
town, on a green pedestal of hill, is the stately,
Classical parish church, commanding sweeping
views across the wide sub-Alpine vale. Here, in
the crowded burial-ground, I searched in vain in
the early months of 1914 for memorials of any
age&mdash;almost every cross or stone had been erected
since I had last passed along this valley, in
driving in the diligence from Meiringen to
Lucerne, not quite a quarter of a century earlier.
The old bone-houses stand nowadays mostly
empty; but the Swiss dead, I suspect, are still
frequently deposited in graves that hold them
only in temporary tenancy. Here, as elsewhere
in Switzerland, you will note the local custom of
often letting a photograph of the deceased into
his head-stone, beneath a protecting sheet of
glass. A mile or two to the south-west of
Sarnen, by the shore of the placid lake, is the
little village of Sachseln, the church of which
(Classical again) is lucky in its possession of the
bones of Bruder Klaus. I remember in 1887,
on the occasion of the drive already mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
passing somewhere in this neighbourhood a long
procession of pilgrims, who were doubtless
making their way to the shrine of the patriot-saint.
"His bones," says Murray, "lie in a
glass case above the high altar, the shutters of
which are opened for travellers, and are also
withdrawn at stated seasons, in order to exhibit
the relics to crowds of pilgrims.... There
is a wooden figure in the transept, clothed
with the saint's veritable robes." I could not,
however, discover this aerial place of sepulchre
when I explored this church in 1914, nor do I
remember the wooden figure, though I found
statues of the saint, and of his grandson, Conrad
Scheuber, in the parish church of Stans. The
same two statements appear substantially in an
old edition in my possession of 1872, and have
perhaps escaped revision; or perhaps my own
memory and observation are at fault. I turn
with little hope to the last edition of the egregious
Baedeker (1913), and find that the burial of the
saint at Sachseln is there entirely ignored. I
find, however, as I expected, the number of
bedrooms, and the rate of pension, at the Kreuz,
the Engel, the Löwe, and the Rössli&mdash;at none of
which doubtless excellent hotels I have ever
stopped, or am ever likely to want to stay!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The big central division of the Lake of Lucerne,
extending from the intersection of the cross to
the great right angle (it is practically a right
angle) at Brunnen that marks the commencement
of the Urner See, or Bay of Uri, is considerably
the largest, and probably in some respects the
most beautiful, but otherwise perhaps the least
interesting, of all five reaches of the lake. It
lacks, indeed, the superlative grandeur of the
Bay of Uri, which corresponds, in English Lakeland,
to the head of Ullswater, or Wastwater&mdash;curiously
so, since in all three cases we have, not
merely a climax of severe and even savage
sterility, but in all the vista up the water is closed
chiefly by a single, great, pyramidal hill: at
Wastwater by Great Gable, at Ullswater by
Caudale Moor, and here, at the Bay of Uri, by
the dark outline of the Bristenstock. The
Urner See, then, is the grandest and most
imposing, and in some lights gloomiest, lake in
Switzerland, though the Walenstadtsee, in Glarus
and Gallen, will in these respects by some be
thought a rival; but the mid-reaches of Lucerne,
to the south of the red cliffs and dark woods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Rigi, and contained towards the west by Pilatus,
and towards the east by the twin Mythen&mdash;the
last three nobly peaked&mdash;excel, I think, in open
sunny beauty. Contrariwise, these reaches have
but small historical interest, with the single
exception of Gersau, as compared with the other
four members: the Tell traditions, as we have
seen, or shall see presently, are confined to the
Bay of Küssnacht and to the lake of Uri;
Arnold von Winkelried and Nicolas von der
Flüe belong to Stans, and Stans, though actually
set back a couple of miles or so from the margin
of the lake, essentially belongs to the Bay of
Alpnach; whilst even the little Lucernersee,
though so humble in scenic splendour, leads at
any rate to the quays of Lucerne itself, with its
girdle of towers and ancient bridges, and with the
banners in its Rathhaus that were wrested from
the Austrian on the field of Sempach, and the
armour there stripped from the dead body of
Duke Leopold. Of most of the villages on this
central reach, or reaches (for the division is sub-divided
by the narrow strait between the Nasen)&mdash;whether
Weggis, Vitznau, Buochs, or Beckenried&mdash;there
is little to be said, save that all are
quaint and characteristic, and that all are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
delightfully situated on the margin of the lake.
Each, of course, is not without its page in
history&mdash;Buochs, for example, was burnt by the
French in 1798; whilst Weggis was only finally
incorporated into the Canton of Lucerne, after
years of struggling independence, in 1535.
Gersau, however, of all this group of littoral
settlements, is in some respects by far the most
significant. This is a mere village, at the foot
of the wooded Hochfluh&mdash;the last big point to
the cast of the strangely isolated Rigi massif, and
apparently the loftiest (5,574 feet), with the
exception of Rigi Kulm. Hardly bigger than
Küssnacht, and decidedly smaller than Brunnen,
this town&mdash;if town it may be called&mdash;of less than
fifteen hundred souls, with its neighbouring strip
of lake-side territory, maintained for more than
four long centuries its status as the smallest
independent sovereign state in Europe. The
place once belonged to the Dukes of Hapsburgh,
who "levied duties on lambs, goatskins, fish, and
grey cloth," and by them it was mortgaged to
the barons of Ramstein, who parted with its
possession to the house of Von Moos, of Lucerne.
From the latter Gersau bought its freedom in
1390 for the sum of 690 pfennigs, which it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
painfully "scraped together after ten years of
hard toil." "They had already, thirty-one years
before, concluded a league with the Four Forest
Cantons, and had even rendered assistance to the
Confederates in the battle of Sempach; where a
native of the town captured the banner of Hohenzollern
and brought it home and placed it in the
church of Gersau, which even in its present form
bears witness to the pride of the little territory."
Thus Gersau freed herself in the Middle Ages
from the house of Hapsburgh, and triumphed
against the house of Hohenzollern, just as civilized
Europe, more than five hundred years
later, agonised and struggled only yesterday:</p>

<p>This central compartment of the lake is
closed towards the east, as already stated, by
the bare rock peaks of the Great and Little
Mythen. These have been compared, unless
I mistake, to the twin Langdale Pikes, in
Westmoreland, as seen from the head of Windermere;
and probably the comparison has just
as much validity as comparisons of the sort are
ever capable of asserting. Nature, who is studious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
never to reproduce herself with complete and
meticulous accuracy, is fond enough of teasing
us with suggestion and reminiscence, and often
enough finds pleasure in moulding "two lovely
berries" on a single stem. The Mythen are
removed, again like Wordsworth's "lusty twins,"
to a quite appreciable distance from the margin
of the lake; but here, whereas in Westmoreland
the intervening country is the sweetest confusion
imaginable of undulating pasture and coppice
along the broken course of the Brathay, the
broad plinth that rises up in slow but persistent
gradient from Brunnen to the foot of the Mythen
is, to the writer's way of thinking (and he knows
of no support from the judgment of other critics),
the weakest bit of composition along the whole
basin of Lucerne, and a tract of country&mdash;it
is luckily very small&mdash;as dull and profitless as any
to be found among the Alps. Yet this, in fact,
as part and parcel of the Canton of Schwyz,
is in a sense the very heart and core of Switzerland,
and the veritable holy cradle of Swiss freedom.
It has given its name to the whole Confederation,
and the little town of Schwyz itself, which is
visible rather too obviously as the land slopes
up in the distance, though with less than eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
thousand inhabitants, might very justly complain
of Berne that the latter has usurped its proper
dignity in attracting to itself the Swiss seat of
federal government. Brunnen, which is called
the port of Schwyz, and from which it is distant
about three miles, is singularly crushed and over-weighted
by the great hotels on the Seelisberg
and the Axenfels, and has suffered perhaps more
severely by the exploitation of its neighbourhood
than any other single station on the lake. The
attraction here, of course, is the majestic Bay
of Uri, which comes into view with startling
suddenness, in a few revolutions of the paddles,
as the steamer approaches the quay at Brunnen;
and whose splendour, luckily, neither monster
hotel, nor monster crowd, nor the presence of the
great St. Gothard railway (here first insistently
apparent on the margin of the lake),</p>

<p class="in0">One would have preferred, no doubt, to have
approached this inner shrine of the hills&mdash;which
is also the inner shrine of the great traditions
of Swiss liberty&mdash;with somewhat less obtrusive
parade of the engineering triumphs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
nineteenth century. One remembers for the
moment how William and Dorothy Wordsworth
came hither, and on foot, in 1820. "We
descended," writes Dorothy in one of her journals,
"by a long flight of steps, into the Vale, and,
after about half a mile's walking, we arrived
at <i>Brunnen</i>. Espied Wm. and M. [her brother,
William, and his wife] upon a crag above the
village, and they directed us to the Eagle Inn,
where I instantly seated myself before a window,
with a long reach of the Lake of Uri before
me, the magnificent commencement to our
regular approach to the St. Gothard Pass of
the Alps. [Hitherto their approach from Calais
had been devious, by way of the Rhine and
the Oberland.] My first feeling was of extreme
delight in the excessive <i>beauty</i> of the scene&mdash;I
had expected something of a more awful impression
from the Lake of Uri; but nothing so
<i>beautiful</i>." There was then no St. Gothard
railway; no over-weening hotels; not even,
perhaps, a steamboat on the lake!</p>

<p>It is singular, perhaps, that neither this superlative
Bay of Uri, nor all its varied traditions of
the Tellsplatte or the Rütli, should have succeeded
in evoking a single verse from the poet
whose inspiration had been kindled to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
splendid effort in Scotland, less than twenty years
previously, by the vision of a sweet-voiced girl by
the spray of a Highland waterfall, by the careless
evening greeting of a woman by a lake. The
magic period of plenary inspiration was passed,
indeed, for Wordsworth at the time of this continental
tour in 1820; and yet it was after his
return to England that he composed the great
sonnet on King's College Chapel. The Rütli
lies across the lake scarcely half an hour's row
from Brunnen, yet it does not appear from
Dorothy's journal that her brother even visited it.
Here, on a green shelf of meadow by the side of
the greener lake, and over-topped towards the
west by the dark woods and cliffs of the
Sonnenberg, are the few square yards of sacred
soil where the three founders of Swiss freedom
met together and conspired, if fables do not lie,
for the rooting out of the Austrian tyrant in
1307. Their actual names are given, and the
very day of meeting&mdash;November 7, in "the dead
vast and middle of the night"&mdash;yet the imp of
modern criticism, which has spared neither Tell
nor Arnold von Winkelried, is clamorous again to
rob us of this famous drama of conjuration on the
Rütli. On the opposite shore of the lake, but
considerably further to the south&mdash;to the south,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
in fact, of the little village of Sisikon, which
itself may be reckoned as roughly the centre of
the Bay of Uri&mdash;on the immediate margin of the
water, and below the great, vertical, twisted precipices
of the dark and towering Axenberg, is
the little ledge of the Tellsplatte, where Tell is
said to have sprung ashore from the boat,
and from the custody of his warders, during
the onslaught of a sudden squall, when on his
way as a prisoner from Altdorf to Küssnacht.
The chapel was rebuilt towards the close of
last century, and is visible as we pass from the
steamer. Behind it runs the great St. Gothard
railway, on its way from Bâle to Milan; and
higher up the cliff is the famous highroad of the
Axenstrasse, which was driven along the face of
these sheer and impracticable precipices, in alternate
cutting, embankment and tunnel, by the zeal
of the Federal Government in 1863&ndash;64, in order
to better the communication between Canton
Ticino and the rest of Switzerland. Ticino, or
Tessin, the fifth largest of the states in acreage
but the seventh in population, lies to the south of
Uri, across the wild pass of the St. Gothard, on
the sunny Italian side of the Alps, and was only
admitted to the Confederation in 1803, though
earlier by a dozen years than units of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
importance as Neuchâtel, Geneva, and the Valais.
One is rather apt to forget that the Switzerland
of the days before the French Revolution&mdash;the
Switzerland whose name is a synonym for liberty;
the Switzerland of Sempach, Morat, and Morgarten&mdash;consisted
only of the thirteen German-speaking
states that are clustered mostly to the
north and west of the original mountain nucleus
of Uri, Unterwalden, and Schwyz.</p>

<p>With Flüelen, exactly at the head of the lake,
we conclude our perambulation of the Vierwaldstättersee.
I do not know that this little village
has much of particular interest; but a couple of
miles beyond it is the small mountain capital of
Uri, where Tell is reported in the immortal
legend to have shot the apple from off his boy's
head, and where his statue still stands in the
diminutive market-place. The vale of the Reuss
at Altdorf, and indeed as far south as Amsteg,
where it is blocked, as it were, by the huge
pyramid of the Bristenstock, and where the floor
of the valley first begins to rise in earnest towards
the far-away <i>col</i> of the St. Gothard, is merely a
prolongation of the mountain basin of the Urnersee,
with the substitution of flat green pasture
for a pavement of crystal lake. Of the Bay of
Uri itself I feel that I have said little, yet feel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
with some sincerity, that there is little to be said.
Its elements, though majestic, are exceedingly
downright and simple, whereas those of the rest
of the Lake of Lucerne are multiform, subtle, and
complex. Whatever be the impression that it
effects on the spectator, it is likely to accomplish
this at once; it is no finer at the head than at the
foot; and all that it has of grandeur (and nothing
of the kind in the Alps is grander) is flashed upon
us in a moment, in complete and final revelation,
when first it comes into vision between the piers
at Trieb and Brunnen. It varies, of course, in
splendour as the day is bright or dull; but less, I
imagine, than the lower reaches of the lake,
which depend more for their effect on screens
of mountain more remote, and are capable of
assuming softer and lovelier colouring exactly
because their atmospheric distances are greater.
In gloom, or rain, or heat-haze, it is the one
division of the lake that will fail to disappoint us,
but perhaps it is also the one division that responds
less readily to the vivifying influences of sunshine
and blue sky. Nor is it really wild, if one may
say so without paradox, in the sense in which
Ennerdale is wild, or Wastdale Head, or Langstrath,
among the familiar fells of Cumberland.
The cliffs that drop directly to its eastern shore are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
indeed tremendous and unapproachable, but above
them, as we know, are gentle Alpine pastures that
are musical with cow-bells, and meadows that are
fragrant with hay and flowers. The tops of
distant snow-clad mountains, again, though visible
from its waters, are really removed to immense
distances, above it and beyond it, and though they
ring it round in insuperable barrier, almost belong
to another world. Land where you can, or will,
and you find your immediate environment scarcely
wilder, if wilder at all, than the lower slopes of
Pilatus or Rigi. It is only, in fact, in the upland
vales of Switzerland&mdash;at spots like the Grimsel
Hospice, or towards the summits of passes like
the Simplon or the Splügen&mdash;that the ordinary
wanderer, who is not a climber, will realize that
<i>abandon</i> of wild and savage sterility that delights
him in a hundred glens among the mountains of
Scotland or Carnarvonshire, in Glen Sannox, or
Glen Sligachan, in Llanberis, or Cwm Llydaw.
The Bay of Uri is indeed majestic, and its framework
of distant summits is indeed magnificently
wild, yet not here, I think, shall we taste with
Shelley the strange</p>
